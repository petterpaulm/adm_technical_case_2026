    "## The Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Company runs 15 trucks across 4 vehicle classes (FHWA Class 5 through 8), all dispatching from a single hub in Cincinnati, OH. The fleet serves 300 order lines at 58 delivery sites scattered across North America -- Toronto, Portland, Las Vegas, Albany, and dozens of cities in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is straightforward to state and brutal to solve. Manually planned routes waste truck capacity, burn excess fuel, and produce unreliable delivery windows. At $3.75 per gallon of diesel, with FMCSA forcing a 10-hour mandatory rest after every 14 hours of driving, bad routing is expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis answers one question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> How should The Company assign orders to trucks and sequence deliveries to minimise total fleet cost while respecting vehicle capacities, federal rest regulations, and delivery commitments?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In operations research, this is a **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)**. The mathematical formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min \\sum_{k \\in K} \\sum_{(i,j) \\in A} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ijk}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every order is delivered exactly once: $\\sum_{k \\in K} y_{ik} = 1 \\;\\forall i \\in N$\n",
    "- No truck exceeds its payload: $\\sum_{i \\in N} q_i \\cdot y_{ik} \\leq Q_k \\;\\forall k \\in K$\n",
    "- Each truck departs from and returns to the depot (flow conservation)\n",
    "- Work hours do not exceed 14 consecutive hours before mandatory 10-hour rest (HOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $x_{ijk} = 1$ if truck $k$ travels arc $(i,j)$, $y_{ik} = 1$ if order $i$ is assigned to truck $k$, $c_{ij}$ is the cost of traversing arc $(i,j)$, $q_i$ is order weight, and $Q_k$ is the capacity of truck $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this hard?** The CVRPTW is NP-hard. With 300 orders and 15 trucks, the number of feasible assignments exceeds $10^{353}$ -- a figure that dwarfs the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe ($\\approx 10^{80}$). No exact algorithm can solve this in practical time. We need heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in concrete terms: imagine you have 15 delivery vans, each with a weight limit, serving 300 customers across the country. Each driver works a maximum of 14 hours before taking a mandatory 10-hour break. You need the cheapest set of routes where every order gets delivered, no truck is overloaded, and no driver violates rest regulations. Now imagine you need to solve this every day as orders change. That is what our algorithms do.\n",

    "## Solver Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing 300 orders across 15 trucks is a combinatorial problem. The solution space grows factorially with the number of orders -- there is no shortcut, no closed-form answer. We built four solvers of increasing sophistication and ran them head-to-head.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Solver | Approach | Runtime | When to use it |\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "| **Greedy** | Nearest-insertion heuristic | ~0.03s | Real-time fallback when a truck breaks down mid-day |\n",
    "| **Column Generation** | LP relaxation with pricing subproblem | ~42s | When you need a provable lower bound on cost |\n",
    "| **ALNS** | Adaptive metaheuristic (destroy/repair) | ~10 min | Daily batch dispatch -- best cost in our experiments |\n",
    "| **Pareto** | Multi-objective (cost vs CO2 vs time) | Variable | Monthly strategic review of fleet trade-offs |\n",
    "\n",
    "### How ALNS Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (Ropke and Pisinger, 2006) operates in a loop of three steps, repeated 6,000 times:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 -- Destroy.** Remove a fraction of orders from the current solution. The fraction $q$ is drawn uniformly from $[0.10, 0.35]$. Four destroy operators compete for selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random removal -- pulls orders at random for diversification\n",
    "- Worst removal -- targets the most expensive orders\n",
    "- Shaw removal -- removes geographically clustered orders to enable structural changes\n",
    "- Route removal -- deletes an entire underperforming route\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 -- Repair.** Reinsert removed orders into feasible positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greedy insertion -- cheapest available slot\n",
    "- Regret-2 insertion -- prioritises orders where the gap between the best and second-best slot is largest (the ones that would hurt most to defer)\n",
    "- Perturbed insertion -- greedy plus random noise to encourage exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 -- Accept or reject.** The new solution is evaluated using a Simulated Annealing criterion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{accept}) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\Delta C \\leq 0 \\\\ e^{-\\Delta C / T} & \\text{if } \\Delta C > 0 \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta C = C_{\\text{new}} - C_{\\text{current}}$ is the cost difference, and $T$ is the temperature, which cools geometrically each iteration: $T_{t+1} = 0.9997 \\cdot T_t$, starting from $T_0 = 500$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms: at the start, the algorithm is willing to accept worse solutions roughly half the time, which lets it escape local optima and explore broadly. As the temperature drops toward zero, it becomes increasingly selective and converges toward the best solution found. This tension between exploration and exploitation is what makes metaheuristics work on hard problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operator adaptation.** Every 100 iterations, the algorithm updates operator weights based on recent performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_i^{(s+1)} = (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot w_i^{(s)} + \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{\\pi_i}{\\theta_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators earn scores: 33 points for finding a new global best, 9 for improving the current solution, 1 for an accepted but non-improving move. Over 6,000 iterations, the algorithm discovers that route-destroy paired with regret-2 repair is the most productive combination for this problem instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Monte Carlo on Top?\n",
    "\n",
    "A deterministic solution assumes perfect information: exact fuel prices, precise travel times, no mechanical failures. None of that holds in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We stress-test every solver's output with 1,000 Monte Carlo trials, applying three sources of uncertainty drawn from industry-calibrated distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | Distribution | Parameters | Source |\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "| Travel time | Log-normal | sigma = 20% | Figliozzi (2010), inter-city trucking CoV |\n",
    "| Fuel price | Normal | sigma = 15% around $3.75/gal | EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report |\n",
    "| Truck breakdown | Bernoulli | p = 0.05 per route | FMCSA roadside inspection out-of-service rate |\n",
    "\n",
    "With 1,000 independent trials, the Central Limit Theorem gives a standard error of $\\sigma / \\sqrt{1000}$, yielding roughly 3% precision on cost estimates at the 95% confidence level. That is more than sufficient for operational decision-making.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Reading the cost-per-mile chart:** The high-CPM outliers (top of chart) are **tiny bubbles** -- they represent very short nearby deliveries (under 10 miles) where fixed labour and maintenance costs get divided by very few miles, inflating the rate. These routes are cheap in absolute dollars (under $50 each). The **fleet-weighted average** annotations show the real per-mile economics: all three strategies run at roughly $1.45-1.47/mi. ALNS saves money not by lowering the per-mile rate, but by **driving 8,200 fewer total miles** through better stop consolidation (3.0 stops/route vs Greedy's 1.8)."

    "### The Four Solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "| Solver | Approach | Mathematical Class |\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "| Greedy | Always picks the nearest unvisited stop | Constructive heuristic (nearest-insertion) |\n",
    "| Column Generation | Routes \"bid\" to serve orders via LP pricing | LP relaxation + Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition |\n",
    "| ALNS | Iteratively destroys and rebuilds parts of the solution, accepting some worse moves to escape local optima | Adaptive metaheuristic with simulated annealing |\n",
    "| Pareto | Optimises cost, CO2, and time simultaneously, returning a set of non-dominated solutions | Multi-objective optimisation (non-dominated sorting) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why There Is No Universal Best\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a known result in combinatorial optimisation: the No Free Lunch Theorem (Wolpert and Macready, 1997) states that no algorithm dominates all others across every possible problem instance. But for our specific structure -- single depot, heterogeneous fleet, HOS constraints -- we can rank them empirically using a composite score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Value Score} = \\frac{\\text{Solution Quality (lower cost)}}{\\text{Computational Budget (runtime)}} \\times \\text{Robustness (MC P95/P50 ratio)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deterministic vs Stochastic Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The charts below compare all four solvers on two dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deterministic cost -- the solution assuming perfect information about fuel prices, travel times, and truck availability\n",
    "2. Monte Carlo robustness -- how the solution holds up when we inject real-world noise (fuel volatility, breakdowns, travel delays)\n",
    "\n",
    "A solver that finds a cheap plan but crumbles under uncertainty is less useful than one that costs slightly more but performs reliably under stress.\n",

    "The bar chart above shows total cost, but the real question for operations is: which cost lever moves the needle the most? The chart below decomposes each solver's total into fuel, labour, and maintenance. ALNS reduces **every** component -- fuel drops from $59.6k to $54.0k, labour from $54.2k to $50.5k, and maintenance from $13.1k to $11.9k. The savings are proportional across all three, which tells us the improvement comes from shorter total distance (fewer miles driven), not from structural changes like fewer trucks or different crew schedules."

    "## Results Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Structure\n",
    "Fuel (46%) and labour (43%) dominate fleet costs. Maintenance is a distant third at 10%. This tells us where optimisation effort pays off the most:\n",
    "1. Shorter routes -- every 100 miles saved means roughly $56 in fuel and $20 in maintenance\n",
    "2. Fewer HOS rest breaks -- each avoided 10-hour rest period saves approximately $250 in dead labour time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operational Efficiency\n",
    "- The ALNS solver packs trucks close to capacity while consolidating more stops per route (up to 7 stops vs Greedy's max of 3), cutting total distance from 87,391 miles to 79,166 miles.\n",
    "- Economies of distance hold up in the data: long-haul routes run about $1.20/mi compared to $1.65/mi for shorter runs. The amortisation curve confirms this is classic fixed-cost dilution.\n",
    "- Five routes exceed $5,000 each and account for a disproportionate share of total spend. These are the prime candidates for consolidation or shifting to rail intermodal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Profile\n",
    "The ALNS solution is robust under stress. Monte Carlo simulation shows the P95 worst-case cost ($126,940) is only about 9% above the deterministic estimate ($116,396) -- and that worst case is still cheaper than what Greedy costs on a good day. Fuel price volatility is the biggest risk factor. Truck breakdowns have minimal impact because the fleet has built-in multi-truck redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Carbon Footprint\n",
    "The ALNS fleet produces 147 tonnes of CO2 across all routes, down from 162 tonnes under Greedy -- a 10% emissions reduction that comes free with the cost savings. The relationship between distance and emissions is almost perfectly linear (R-squared above 0.99), which means route length is the single best predictor of carbon impact."

    "## Limitations of This Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Every model simplifies reality. The value of listing limitations is not to apologise for the work -- it is to show exactly where the assumptions break down and how to fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Distance Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Haversine formula (great-circle distance on a sphere) scaled by a 1.30 road factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{\\text{road}}(i,j) = 1.30 \\times 2R \\arcsin\\!\\left(\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\!\\left(\\frac{\\phi_j - \\phi_i}{2}\\right) + \\cos\\phi_i \\cos\\phi_j \\sin^2\\!\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_j - \\lambda_i}{2}\\right)}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R = 3{,}959$ mi (Earth radius), $\\phi$ = latitude, $\\lambda$ = longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1.30 factor comes from empirical studies (Boscoe et al., 2012) showing that US road distances average 1.25 to 1.40 times the straight-line distance. We use the midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this misses: mountain passes, construction zones, toll roads, urban congestion. A production system should call the Google Maps Distance Matrix API or OSRM for actual road-network distances with real-time traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Single-Depot Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "All 33 routes start and end at Cincinnati, OH. This matches The Company's current hub-and-spoke model, but it prevents us from exploring multi-depot routing (for example, adding a western hub in Denver or Dallas), open-ended routes where trucks finish at the last delivery, or cross-docking at intermediate warehouses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding even one western depot could cut total fleet cost by 15-25% by eliminating the longest cross-country legs to Las Vegas, Portland, and Seattle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Deterministic Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume all 300 orders are known upfront. In practice, orders arrive throughout the day, customers change quantities, and agricultural commodities have seasonal peaks. Our Monte Carlo simulation partially addresses this by stress-testing under fuel and travel uncertainty, but a full stochastic VRP formulation would model demand as a Poisson arrival process and re-optimise on rolling horizons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Constant Speed Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume 55 mph average speed for all trucks. In reality, Class 8 heavy trucks are slower on grades than Class 5 medium trucks, urban segments run 25-35 mph versus 65 mph on interstate highways, and speed varies by time of day and weather. A better model would use speed profiles per road segment from historical telematics data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Cost Model Simplifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Our three-component model (fuel + labour + maintenance) leaves out toll roads ($50-200 per route on eastern turnpikes), insurance and registration (fixed, should be pro-rated per route), cargo insurance (varies by commodity value), opportunity cost (a truck on a 5-day Las Vegas run cannot serve local Cincinnati orders), and driver overtime structures under HOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. No Customer Time Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "The model enforces driver HOS constraints but not customer delivery windows (for example, \"deliver between 9 AM and 2 PM\"). Adding hard time windows would drastically reduce the feasible solution space, require penalty functions for violations, and better reflect real service level agreements.\n",
